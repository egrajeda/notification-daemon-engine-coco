Hello, this is my attempt to simulate the notification system used by Ubuntu (NotifyOSD) on the widely used notification-daemon.

It is far from reaching its goal, but I'm working on it and I'll appreciate any feedbacks, patches, suggestions, insults, cookies, laptops :D.

What do I get with this engine?
-------------------------------

Your notifications will look like this:

Drawbacks?
----------
Of course there are. I've disabled some features that most notification-daemon themes have, so it would look more like NotifyOSD:

* No close button
* If the notification had buttons, they won't appear.
* There is no way to see the urgency
* Disabled all kind of arrows (see the next section for more about this)

I'm quite sure there is another one, but I don't remember it right now :P.

Notifications attached to status icons/widgets
----------------------------------------------
Since this theme doesn't display arrows, the notifications that are supposed to appear near a certain icon or widget will look weird. 

The behavior I wanted is that **all** notifications should appear on the top right corner (or wherever you chose to), and that can't be done in here, it must be done in libnotify.

So I did a little hack on the last version as of now (23/03/2010) and you can find it on:
